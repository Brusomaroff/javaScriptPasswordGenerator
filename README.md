# Password Generator 

## Step 1: I had to have prompt messages apear when clicking the Generate Password button

## Step 2: I had to give the user option to select which criteria they want in their password

## Step 3: I had to make sure the password was 8-128 characters long

## Step 4: I had to specify the options for the user so: lowercase, uppercase, numbers, and/or special characters

## Step 5: I had to make sure that the prompt messages functioned correctly and that the user has to choose atleast one option for password criteria

## Step 6: When chosen all the criteria for password I had to have the password display in the box with the users matching criteria
